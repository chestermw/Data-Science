###What is the Law of Large Numbers?

[Wikepdia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers)
> In probability theory, the law of large numbers (LLN) is a theorem that describes the result of performing the same experiment a large number of times. According to the law, the average of the results obtained from a large number of trials should be close to the expected value, and will tend to become closer as more trials are performed.
